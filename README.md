Stand: Player stands pat with his cards.

Hit: Player draws another card. If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21 then he loses.

Double: Player doubles his bet and gets one, and only one, more card.

If both the player and dealer bust, nobody wins and none of the players money is lost.
