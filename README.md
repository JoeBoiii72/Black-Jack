Stand: Player stands pat with his cards.

Hit: Player draws another card. If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21 then he loses.

Double: Player doubles his bet and gets one, and only one, more card.

If both the player and dealer bust, nobody wins and none of the players money is lost.

Total money you start with is hard coded in, as well as the bet amount each round.
The ability to change this ingame has yet to be added.
